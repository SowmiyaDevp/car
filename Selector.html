    <p>Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that can be used as a platform in itself. It is a fast, secure, reliable programming language for coding everything from mobile apps and enterprise software to big data applications and server-side. <br> OOps in java is to improve code readability and reusability by defining a Java program efficiently. The main principles of object-oriented programming are abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism . <br> Inheritance in Java is the method to create a hierarchy between classes by inheriting from other classes. Java Inheritance is transitive - so if Sedan extends Car and Car extends Vehicle, then Sedan is also inherited from the Vehicle class. <br> Polymorphism in Java is the task that performs a single action in different ways. So, languages that do not support polymorphism are not 'Object-Oriented Languages', but 'Object-Based Languages'. Ada, for instance, is one such language. Since Java supports polymorphism, it is an Object-Oriented Language.</p>
